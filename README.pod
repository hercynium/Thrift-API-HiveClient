=head1 NAME

Thrift::API::HiveClient - A Hadoop Hive client using the Thrift API

=head1 VERSION

version 0.003

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<THIS CODE IS ALPHA-QUALITY, EXPERIMENTAL, AND LIKELY FLAMMABLE>

That said, I decided it would be nice to make it easy to connect to a Hadoop Hive server via
its Thrift interface and that's what this module provides. It tries to keep the gory details
from you and make things as simple as possible. The majority of the code in this dist was
generated by the thrift compiler, but is hidden behind the friendly facade of the module
whose documentation you are reading now. Enjoy, and please feel free to send bug reports
and/or patches!

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 host

The host on which the hiveserver process is running. Should be a
valid hostname or IP address. I<required>, I<immutable>

=head2 port

The TCP port on which the hiveserver process is listening. Should be
a valid port number. I<required>, I<immutable>

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new( ... )

Standard object constructor. Arguments are the attributes described above. For example:

  my $cli = Thrift::API::HiveClient->new( host => 'localhost', port => 10000 );

=head2 connect( )

Connect to the configured hiveserver.

=head1 METHODS FROM ThriftHive

These are the methods exposed by the Thrift API. The HiveClient object simply acts
as a proxy for all the methods available on the (underlying) ThriftHiveClient object.

However, for your convenience, all these methods are documented here, as well as I can.

=head2 execute( $hql )

The given HQL statement is sent to the hiveserver and executed. The results can be
retrieved by using the fetch* methods.

  $cli->execute('select * from foo');

=head2 fetchOne( )

=head2 fetchN( $num )

=head2 fetchAll( )

All results from a previous call to execute() are returned as an array

  my $res = $cli->fetchAll();

=head2 getSchema( )

=head2 getThriftSchema( )

=head2 getClusterStatus( )

Returns an object (blessed hash) showing some of the status of the Hadoop cluster.
